## 1. Introduction.
<img src="gitlab.png" height="110">
GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git-repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc. The software was created by Ukrainians Dmitriy Zaporozhets and Valery Sizov, and is used by several large tech companies including Cisco, IBM, Sony, JÃ¼lich Research Center, NASA, Alibaba, Oracle, Invincea, O'Reilly Media, Leibniz-Rechenzentrum (LRZ), CERN, European XFEL, GNOME Foundation, Boeing, Autodata, NVIDIA, and SpaceX.
<br /><br />
The code was originally written in Ruby, with some parts later rewritten in Go, initially as a source code management solution to collaborate with his team on software development. It later evolved to an integrated solution covering the software development life cycle, and then to the whole DevOps life cycle. The current technology stack includes Go, Ruby on Rails and Vue.js.
<br /><br />
GitLab follows an open-core development model where the core functionality is released under an open-source (MIT) license while the additional functionality is under a proprietary license.
<br /><br />
GitLab users in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria may not be accessible after the migration to Google. Google has informed GitLab developers that there are legal restrictions that are imposed for those countries by Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States.
